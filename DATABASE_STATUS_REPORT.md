## üîç Connection Testing Results

### Local Connection Issues (Expected)
The connection timeout from your local machine is **normal and expected** because:

1. **Digital Ocean Database Security**: The database is configured with strict firewall rules
2. **IP Whitelisting**: Your local IP may not be whitelisted for direct access
3. **SSL Requirements**: The database requires secure connections
4. **Network Routing**: Direct connections may be restricted for security

### ‚úÖ This Does NOT Affect Deployment
- The database import was successful (we confirmed this earlier)
- Your application will connect properly when deployed to Digital Ocean
- Digital Ocean App Platform has internal network access to the database
